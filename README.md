# My Youtube userstyle to hide annoying shit

## What it hides

### on videos page
* round corners
* shorts from sidebar
* current channel block from sidebar
* don't hide cursor unless fullscreen
* history popup
* ai crap

### on search results page
* shorts
* suggestions
* crisis panel (if you want it just remove "ytd-emergency-onebox-renderer" class and comma before)
* people also search

### on subscriptions page
* shorts
* top ui panel (same class as shorts but useless and too tall anyways)

## What it adds
* option to choose number of videos per row and min screen width (1366px by default)
