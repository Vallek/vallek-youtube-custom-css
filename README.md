# My Youtube userstyle to hide annoying shit

**10.2025 upd** removed old controls css as new ui rolled out to more people everywhere it looks like. Maybe will make style that restores old ui (not likely too much work). Maybe adapt to existing style that restores old ui (couldn't find one yet).

## What it hides

### on videos page
* round corners
* shorts from sidebar
* current channel block from sidebar
* don't hide cursor unless fullscreen

### on search results page
* shorts
* suggestions
* crisis panel (if you want it just remove "ytd-emergency-onebox-renderer" class and comma before)
* people also search

### on subscriptions page
* shorts
* top ui panel (same class as shorts but useless and too tall anyways)

## What it adds
* option to choose number of videos per row and min screen width (1366px by default)
