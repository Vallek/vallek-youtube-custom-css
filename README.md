# My Youtube userstyle to hide annoying shit

**08.2025 upd** does not work with new yt video ui. I will look into options here. Maybe will just disable watch ui part (most likely). Maybe will make style that restores old ui (not likely too much work). Maybe adapt to existing style that restores old ui (couldn't find one yet).

## What it hides

### on videos page
* round corners
* shadow behind ui controls
* next video button
* shorts from sidebar
* current channel block from sidebar
* don't hide cursor unless fullscreen

### on search results page
* shorts
* suggestions
* crisis panel (if you want it just remove "ytd-emergency-onebox-renderer" class and comma before)
* people also search

### on subscriptions page
* shorts
* top ui panel (same class as shorts but useless and too tall anyways)

## What it adds
* Adds more visible outlines, smaller shadows and background-colors to make UI visible without big shadow.
* option to choose number of videos per row and min screen width (1366px by default)
