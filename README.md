# My Youtube userstyle to hide annoying shit

## What it hides

### on videos page
* round corners
* shadow behind ui controls
* next video button

### on search results page
* shorts
* suggestions
* crisis panel (if you want it just remove "ytd-emergency-onebox-renderer" class and comma before)

### on subscriptions page
* shorts
* top ui panel (same class as shorts but useless and too heigh anyways)
